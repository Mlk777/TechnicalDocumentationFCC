        GitHub is a web-based hosting serve for version control using Git. It offers all the distributed version control and <abbr title="Source Code Management">SCM</abbr> of Git as well as adding its own features like bug tracking, task management, wikis and so on. GitHub is free allowing you to have multiple repositories publicly accesible. It also offers plans to hosts private repositories.<br>
        We'll use GitHub to host our repository. Go on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page and register.<br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have registered click the "New repository" button to create a new repository. Give it a name, a description and leave it in public. You can chose to initialize the repository with a README.md allowing you to immediately clone the repo onto your computer. On the other hand if you're importing an existing repo skip this step.<br><br>
      </p>

        For simplicity we will click on initialize this repository with a README.
